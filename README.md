Market simulator, a Python project

This is a market simulator created for a computational investing course, my first true Python program. It reads in a CSV of orders and outputs the performance of that portfolio over the range of transactions, evaluating on such factors as average daily performance and Sharpe ratio.

The performance is compared to a benchmark standard, such as the S&P 500 or any equity of the user's choice.
